### This is a rust single throw Yatzee generator
Using the rust built in random number generator, will create dice throws of 5 dice, 1-6, and when a single throw yatzee is found, displays how long it took.

Just a simple program I decided to write to help learn rust (inspired by numberphile on youtube)

build with rust nightly, or using multirust

cargo run

or

cargo build --relase
